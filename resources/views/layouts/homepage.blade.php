            This content can be sponsored pieces, reviews, guides, endorsements, or tutorials, among other formats. The influencer effectively introduces your business or product to a potentially responsive and engaged audience by sharing this content with their audience. Creating real, pertinent material that appeals to the influencer's following and your brand's message is the secret to effective influencer marketing."
